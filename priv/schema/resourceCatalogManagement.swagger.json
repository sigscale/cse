They can be drawn from the Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and technology components.\nA ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a particular ResourceSpecification."
